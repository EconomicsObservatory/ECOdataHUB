Welcome to the ECOdataHUB!

## ðŸ“Š Data

All of our chart data are published under their respective article subfolders, but on top of that we also operate the **[ECOdataHUB](https://github.com/EconomicsObservatory/ecodatahub)**, where you will find a trove of data used in our articles and analyses, as well as interactive visualisation exploration interfaces. Whenever possible, we try to follow a [TIDY](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf) format. 

## ðŸŒŒ Visualisations

Head over to our **[ECOvisualisations](https://github.com/EconomicsObservatory/ecovisualisations)** repository for all of our charts sorted by article. We try to follow industry best-practices in data visualisation and try to establish our very own visualisation guidelines for all chart types. You can read about these, as well as the tools we use in [guidelines](https://github.com/EconomicsObservatory/ECOvisualisations/tree/main/guidelines).   

## ðŸ“§ Contact

The Economics Observatory is run out of the [University of Bristol](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/) and you can read more **[about us here](https://www.economicsobservatory.com/about)**.
