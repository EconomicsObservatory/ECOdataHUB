Welcome to the ECOdataHUB!

## ðŸ“Š Data

All of our chart data are published under their respective article subfolders, but on top of that we also operate the **[ECOdataHUB](https://github.com/EconomicsObservatory/ecodatahub)**, where you will find a trove of data used in our articles and analyses, as well as interactive visualisation exploration interfaces. Whenever possible, we try to follow a [TIDY](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf) format. 

### Structure

You will find the datasets we curate and mirror in the [**data**](/data) folder, sorted as `provider/dataset/series`. Whenever possible, and unless absolute necessary for the visualisation, we strive to maintain a "mirror only" attitude - i.e. most of the files are direct backups of the original API call responses. Whenever new data becomes availabe, these datasets update automatically. 
### Panels
Under **[panels](/panels)** each visualisation has their own (typically [Vega](http://vega.github.io/)) `json` specification. We normalize the data and compile the visualisations using the [**`parser.ipynb`**](/panels/lms/parser.ipynb) [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebook. Every **panel** folder contains 3 visualisation specification files:
- In `*_eco.json` the data for the visualisation is loaded from this repository (recommended use)
- In `*_live.json` the data for the visualisation is loaded directly from its original location (e.g. [ONS API](https://developer.ons.gov.uk/)) 
- In `*_local.json` all data is stored as a static `Javascript Object` inside the `json` files (this is the safest but also the slowest)

### Embedding
Furthermore, we maintain a `viewer.html` in every **panel** folder that can take a data source parameters as its URL hash. E.g. visiting [`/lms/viewer.html#lms_eco`](https://economicsobservatory.github.io/ECOdataHUB/panels/lms/viewer.html#lms_eco) will open the viewer for the `lms` dataset with the `eco` data source specification. **This is the recommended way** for embedding our visualisations on other sites.

## ðŸŒŒ Visualisations

Head over to our **[ECOvisualisations](https://github.com/EconomicsObservatory/ecovisualisations)** repository for all of our charts sorted by article. We try to follow industry best-practices in data visualisation and try to establish our very own visualisation guidelines for all chart types. You can read about these, as well as the tools we use in [guidelines](https://github.com/EconomicsObservatory/ECOvisualisations/tree/main/guidelines).   

## ðŸ’» Build
We are constantly expanding the capabiltiies of the ECOdataHUB. If you discovered any bugs or have any specific suggestions or feature requests please use the [Issues](https://github.com/EconomicsObservatory/ECOdataHUB/issues) page.

## ðŸ“§ Contact
